            <h2>Fundraising FAQs</h2>
            <h3>How do I use donuts as a fundraiser?</h3>
            <p>It's simple. Your group pre-sells orders and collects the money from your
                customers. You let us know how many dozen you need and when you want to
                pick them up. On the specified day, you pick up your donuts, pay for them, and
                deliver them to your customers. You've already made your profit and you're not
                stuck with un-sold donuts.</p>
            <h3>What's the minimum order?</h3>
            <p>You must order a minimum of 10 dozen donuts. We have additional price
                breaks if you order 50 dozen or more.</p>
            <h3>What's the maximum order?</h3>
            <p>There is no maximum order. If you are planning a large-scale fundraiser, we
                recommend spreading it out over two or three weeks so your group has time
                to pre-sell orders, collect the money, and deliver the donuts.</p>
            <h3>Can I order something besides plain, glazed donuts?</h3>
            <p>Yes, but the prices are higher. You can order chocolate-glazed yeast donuts and
                a variety of jelly-filled donuts. These are packaged only as dozens and we
                cannot mix varieties in a box.</p>
            <h3>How much notice do you need for fundraising orders?</h3>
            <p>We require 24 hour notice. You can make minor last-minute adjustments to
                the order the evening prior to pick up.</p>
            <h3>Can you deliver our donuts to us?</h3>
            <p>In some cases we are able to deliver your donuts but there is a delivery fee for
                this service. Please call if you need delivery service and we will work to
                accomodate you.</p>
            <h3>Can you provide a form for taking orders?</h3>
            <p>We do not provide order forms because everyone's needs are different.
                However, the minimum information you should obtain when taking orders
                includes: 1) Customer's name; 2) Customer's phone number; 3) Quantity of
                donuts ordered (dozens only); 4) Types of donuts ordered if selling more than
                one variety; 5) Amount of money collected from customer.</p>
            <h3>Who can buy donuts at fundraising prices?</h3>
            <p>Individuals can buy them to generate their own personal income as can sports
                groups, churches, schools or any organization that needs to raise money. The
                nice thing about our fundraising program is that it can be done on short notice
                when funds are needed quickly.</p>
