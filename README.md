# Resources
* [Ribbon Builder](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/ribbon/)

I used this website to learn how to create ribbon headers for all of my pages.

* [Confirm Mailto Plugin](http://mmoustafa.com/experiments/mailto/)

I used this plugin to confirm whether or not the user actually wants to send an email to the email link they clicked on. You can see this in action on the distributor and contact pages.

* [Textillate Plugin](http://textillate.js.org)

I used this plugin to make all of my h1's rollin letter by letter on every page when the page loads/refreshes.

# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
### Errors on Index.html
Validator does not like the way Google fonts combines fonts in one tag.
I needed to make a <p> under the <h1> to make the ribbon look right.
Validator does not like that MapQuest embedding.
### Errors on menu.html, distributors.html, fundraising.html
Validator does not like the way Google fonts combines fonts in one tag.
### Errors on contact.html

### Outliner Issues
The Outliner couldn't read my ribbon headers so it looks like my pages don't have an <h1>.
